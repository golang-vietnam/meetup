## Golang Vietnam Meetup Wiki

[![Meetup 01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang-vietnam/meetup/master/images/cover.jpg)](/images/cover.jpg)

The very first meetup event of Vietnamese Gophers with many helps from Dwarves Foundation, GDG Vietnam, Silicon Straits Saigon and Liti Solutions. 

We will introduce Google Go to you and announce the exist of our community. 

### About us:

Founded in 2014, this meetup is the place for all beginner and experienced #golang programmers in Vietnam.

We meet on the second and fourth Tuesdays of the month. Second Tuesdays are for one or more talks, and fourth Tuesdays are just hackfests, where people bring their laptops and hang out.

Discuss all #golang related topics, meet other developers and other interesting folks. Presentations, workshops, hack-fests and more. Meet other developers, find out about interesting projects and opportunities for work and potential employment. Join the group and you'll get a weekly newsletter with lots of great beginner material.
